# Visio-Relations-Based-Shape-Manipulation-Tool
The tool allows to manipulate selected tools in relation to other shapes.
Place holders in script translate the shape name of relative shapes.

In a hierarchy (Graph) this would be:
[P]: parent shape,
[L]: left sibling,
[R]: right sibling,
[Nx]: next shape in Graph,
[Pr]: previous shape in Graph
